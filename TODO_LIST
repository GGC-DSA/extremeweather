### This is a short to-do list of what we would like the future of this project to contain 

* Analyzing location data of the tornados to build an interactive map as well as see if tornados are happening in different areas now than they did in the past 
* Introduce newer tornado data from 2015 onward 
* Bring in more official data from government/weather tracking websites and databases 
* Make use of more advanced machine learning and predictive algorithms to predict if tornados will become stronger or more frequent 
* Include datasets that have useful data like temperature and air pressure to answer more questions of how and why tornados happen to see if certain conditions can be predicted
