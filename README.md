## Project Overview 

### Team Members 
* Project Documenter - Samuel Dean: Data Modeler and Analyzer 
* Team Manager - Matthew Bauer: Visualization and Analyzer 

### Description 
Project description provided by client - Climate change can be a factor in human health, yet many impacts are unknown. Consider the list of National Health Topics provided by the CDC [1]. Choose a topic, research an associated metric of human health linked to climate, and use an available climate model to forecast the impact of climate on your health topic.

We currently are using datasets that have tracked tornadoes over 50 years

Our current Hypothesis are: 

Hypothesis 1: The global warming and hotter temperatures is creating more higher F-Scale tornados and causing more destruction.

Hypothesis 2: Property loss damage/Fatalities will continues to rise due to more frequent tornados

Hypothesis 3: Longer and wider tornados have been happening more and more in the last 20 years

Hypothesis 4: Evening time (hottest part of the day) are when the higher F-Scale tornados happen more frequently

Hypothesis 5: Tornados are lasting longer and traveling farther distances

### Technologies
