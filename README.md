### Description 
Project description provided by client - Climate change can be a factor in human health, yet many impacts are unknown. Consider the list of National Health Topics provided by the CDC [1]. Choose a topic, research an associated metric of human health linked to climate, and use an available climate model to forecast the impact of climate on your health topic.

We currently are using datasets that have tracked tornadoes over 50 years

Our Hypotheses: 

Hypothesis 1: F-Scale 5 tornados are the deadliest 

Hypothesis 2: Tornado count per year has risen since 1950 

Hypothesis 3: Longer and wider tornados have been happening more and more in the last 20 years

Hypothesis 4: The average F-Scale is higher in the warmer months (summer) compared to any other part of the year 


### Technologies 
* Python programming language 
* Jupyter Notebook for statistics and visualization 
* Github
* Jira
* DeepNote for notebook collaboration 
* w3schools for building website and using HTML
